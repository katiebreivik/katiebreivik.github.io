                I'm currently a PhD candidate at Northwestern University 
                and a member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration 
                and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA). My primary focus of research
                is populations of compact binaries residing in the Milky Way as sources
                of gravitational waves.
