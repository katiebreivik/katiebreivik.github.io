                I'm currently a PhD candidate at Northwestern University 
                and a member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration 
                and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA). My primary focus of 
                research is simulation of populations of compact binaries 
                residing in the Milky Way. 
                <br>
                I'm particularly interested in trying to understand how  
                obeservations of compact binary systemsby both ground and 
                space-based gravitational wave detectors will help constrain 
                binary evolution models.
